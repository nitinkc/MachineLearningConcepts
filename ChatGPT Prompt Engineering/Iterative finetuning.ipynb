    "    URL shortening services like bit.ly or TinyURL are very popular to generate shorter aliases for long URLs. You need to design this kind of web service where if a user gives a long URL then the service returns a short URL and if the user gives a short URL then it returns the original long URL. For example, shortening the given URL through TinyURL: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-your-dream-job-with-amazon-sde-test-series/?ref=leftbar-rightbar\n",
    "    We get the result given below:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    https://tinyurl.com/y7vg2xjl\n",
    "    A lot of candidates might be thinking that designing this service is not difficult. When a user gives a long URL converts it into a short URL and updates the database and when the user hits the short URL then search the short URL in the database, get that long URL, and redirect the user to the original URL. Is it really simple? Absolutely not if we think about the scalability of this service. \n",
    "    When you’re asked this question in your interviews don’t jump into the technical details immediately. Most of the candidates make mistakes here and immediately they start listing out some bunch of tools, databases, and frameworks. In this kind of question, the interviewer wants a high-level design idea where you can give the solution for the scalability and durability of the service. \n",
    "    Let’s start by talking about the requirement first… \n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Requirement\n",
    "    Before you jump into the solution always clarify all the assumptions you’re making at the beginning of the interview. Ask questions to identify the scope of the system. This will clear the initial doubt, and you will get to know what specific detail the interviewer wants to consider in this service. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Given a long URL, the service should generate a shorter and unique alias for it.\n",
    "    When the user hits a short link, the service should redirect to the original link.\n",
    "    Links will expire after a standard default time span.\n",
    "    The system should be highly available. This is really important to consider because if the service goes down, all the URL redirection will start failing.\n",
    "    URL redirection should happen in real time with minimal latency.\n",
    "    Shortened links should not be predictable.\n",
    "    Let’s start by making some assumptions about the traffic (for scalability) and the length of the URL. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Traffic\n",
    "    Let’s assume our service has 30M new URL shortenings per month. Let’s assume we store every URL shortening request (and associated shortened link) for 5 years. For this period the service will generate about 1.8 B records. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    30 million * 5 years * 12 months = 1.8B\n",
    "    3. URL Length\n",
    "    Let’s consider we are using 7 characters to generate a short URL. These characters are a combination of 62 characters [A-Z, a-z, 0-9] something like http://ad.com/abXdef2.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Data Capacity Modeling\n",
    "    Discuss the data capacity model to estimate the storage of the system. We need to understand how much data we might have to insert into our system. Think about the different columns or attributes that will be stored in our database and calculate the storage of data for five years. Let’s make the assumption given below for different attributes… \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Consider the average long URL size of 2KB ie for 2048 characters.\n",
    "    Short URL size: 17 Bytes for 17 characters\n",
    "    created_at- 7 bytes\n",
    "    expiration_length_in_minutes -7 bytes\n",
    "    The above calculation will give a total of 2.031KB per shortened URL entry in the database. If we calculate the total storage then for 30 M active users total size = 30000000 * 2.031 = 60780000 KB = 60.78 GB per month. In a Year of 0.7284 TB and in 5 years 3.642 TB of data. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    We need to think about the reads and writes that will happen on our system for this amount of data. This will decide what kind of database (RDBMS or NoSQL) we need to use.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. URL Shortening Logic (Encoding)\n",
    "    To convert a long URL into a unique short URL we can use some hashing techniques like Base62 or MD5. We will discuss both approaches. \n",
    "    Base62 Encoding: Base62 encoder allows us to use the combination of characters and numbers which contains A-Z, a-z, 0–9 total( 26 + 26 + 10 = 62). So for 7 characters short URL, we can serve 62^7 ~= 3500 billion URLs which is quite enough in comparison to base10 (base10 only contains numbers 0-9 so you will get only 10M combinations). If we use base62 making the assumption that the service is generating 1000 tiny URLs/sec then it will take 110 years to exhaust this 3500 billion combination. We can generate a random number for the given long URL and convert it to base62 and use the hash as a short URL id. \n",
